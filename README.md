# Job-Market-Unemployment-Dashboard
This dashboard visualizes job market unemployment trends from 2023â€“2025, highlighting total postings, top in-demand jobs, unemployment rates, and state-by-state/job-segment breakdowns. I analyzed employment data, created interactive visuals, and built insights into demand, demographics, and unemployment patterns.
